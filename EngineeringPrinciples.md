Engineering Principles
=======================

1. **Build what matters** Engineering effort is a scarce commodity.
It should only be applied to problems that "move the needle" for
the company.

1. **Be a scientist** Science is a systematic enterprise that builds
and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and
predictions about the universe. We should base our decisions on
objective data obtained through research rather than hunches or
superstition. To improve is to change.

1. **Know your enemies** Conway's Law, sleep deprivation, subjective
beliefs, lax validation, crappy dependencies, unreliable networks,
scope creep etc... Know them and have a plan to beat them.

1. **Always leave it better than you found it** Fix bad designs, wrong
decisions, and poor code when you see them. Broken windows lead to more
broken windows.

1. **Don’t repeat yourself** Every piece of knowledge/process must
have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a
system.

1. **Clear Code Beats Clever Code** Don't write code you can't debug
at 3AM while drunk. Never name a variable 'data' or 'info'. If the
implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

1. **It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It** There’s no
point in having great ideas if you don’t communicate them effectively.
Be conscious of both your words and your tone.

1. **Be a Craftsman** Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to
sign their work. We should be, too. A product's quality is only 
as good as its weakest part. This can manifest itself as
well documented modules, open-sourcing our tools, or just giving
brown-bags on things you've made.

1. **Protect your Culture** A diversity of opinions is a good thing.
An objective respect for the scientific approach to finding the
best answers to organizational problems leads to a stronger bond
between all of us. Only hire people we would want in the office
*tomorrow*.

1. **Collaborate, Don't Corroborate** Asking for input on 80% done
work isn't fair to the reviewer. Don't get peer support just to
make yourself feel better. Encourage peer support when you're 20%
done, to allow for more meaningful collaboration.

1. **Don’t Gather Requirements, Dig for Them** Requirements rarely
lie on the surface. They’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions,
misconceptions, and politics. To think like a user, work with a
user.
